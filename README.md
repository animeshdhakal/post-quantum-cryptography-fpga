# Hardware Acceleration of Post Quantum Cryptography

Someday the world will be in the edge of cyber destruction due to the quantum computer being able to crack any kind of encryption. This is possible due to Shor's algorithm.
In this project we are trying to implement the Crystals Kyber algorithm (KEM) in hardware using System Verilog. Crystals Kyber is one of the different algorithms defined by the NIST post quantum cryptography standardization process.
